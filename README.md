# Robot Model with URDF in Gazebo
This repository contains a custom robot model described using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) and simulated in Gazebo. The robot model includes various sensors such as LIDAR, IMU, and a camera, which are configured and spawned in a Gazebo simulation environment.

# Features
URDF-based Robot Model: The robot is described using URDF, a format commonly used for robot modeling in ROS.
Sensors Integrated:
LIDAR: 2D laser scanner for environment mapping and obstacle detection.
IMU: Inertial measurement unit to provide orientation and acceleration data.
Camera: A visual sensor for capturing images of the simulated environment.
Gazebo Simulation: The robot is spawned in a Gazebo simulation environment with the necessary plugins to simulate sensor behavior.
